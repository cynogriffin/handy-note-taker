# Handy Note Taker

This project demonstrates proficiency in building a backend server through Node.js and Express.js to produce a functional web application that can store user inputted information. It allows users to enter in notes that are stored on the server side and can be referenced or deleted by the user at a later time.

In this project, I learned how to take built front end code and use it to construct a backend that would make the site functional using Express.js, connect the back end to the front end, and deploy the application to a live server in Heroku. My main challenge in this project was trying to figure out how the front end code was set up and making it work with my back end that I created. Since this is usually opposite from a standard production environment (where the backend is usually created first) a majority of my time on this project was actually spent bugfixing and looking at the code to figure out how everything was going to work together. I also went through the extra trouble of adding a delete feature that uses the unique id created with each new note, so that took a good amount of time to figure out and get functional.

The live production version of this application can be accessed on Heroku [here](https://pure-headland-10773.herokuapp.com/). Please feel free to use and test the application and let me know of any improvements or suggestions via my contact information in the Questions section.
